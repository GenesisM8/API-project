# Overview

Hello there! This is SkyBnb, an online platform that functions similarly to Airbnb.

SkyBnb currently enables users to engage with two key features:

1. Full CRUD for Listing Spots: create, view, update, and delete spot listings, providing you with control over your property details.
2. Leave Reviews: Share your experiences by leaving reviews and manage them by deleting when necessary.

I have exciting plans on the horizon, including the implementation of booking features and integration of AWS, which will further enhance your experience. Enjoy using SkyBnb!
